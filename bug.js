This error typically occurs when the Expo CLI is unable to locate or properly install necessary dependencies or when there are conflicts between different versions of Expo modules or other packages used in your project.  It's often linked to issues with your project's `package.json` file, `node_modules` directory, or the Expo CLI's configuration.

**Example Scenario:**  Imagine your `package.json` lists `expo` version 47, but `expo-cli` is at version 46.  The versions aren't compatible, causing this cryptic error message.
