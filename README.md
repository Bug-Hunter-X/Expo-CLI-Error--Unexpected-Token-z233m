# Expo CLI Error: Unexpected Token

This repository demonstrates a common yet cryptic error encountered when using the Expo CLI: "Unexpected token". This often stems from version mismatches between Expo packages or a corrupted project setup.

## Problem

The error message is usually insufficient for debugging, providing only "Unexpected token".  It might appear during various Expo CLI commands (e.g., `expo start`, `expo build`).

## Solution

The solution involves systematically addressing potential conflicts and ensuring a clean project environment.

1. **Verify Package Versions:** Check your `package.json` for version compatibility between `expo`, `expo-cli`, and other Expo modules.  Inconsistent versions can lead to unexpected errors.
2. **Reinstall Dependencies:** Delete your `node_modules` folder and reinstall packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`. This often resolves issues caused by corrupted or incomplete installations.
3. **Clear Expo Cache:** Clear the Expo CLI cache using `expo start --clear`. This can clear out old or conflicting configurations.
4. **Check for Typos:** Double-check your `package.json` file for any typos in dependency names or versions. 
5. **Global Expo CLI Version:** Ensure you have the latest Expo CLI installed globally and not a local one conflicting with the project's expo version.
